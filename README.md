Hosting a Static Website using Amazon S3
======

Introduction
------------
Our goal is learn more about Amazon Web Services. This instruction will host a static website on Amazon S3.
Azure Cloud and Google Cloud Platform also offer the same storage technology which can host website using storage.
We can also maximize Amazon's "Free Tier" for this project.

### What is a Static Website?
A static website contains Web pages with fixed content. Each page is coded in HTML and displays the same information to every visitor. Static sites are the most basic type of website and are the easiest to create. Unlike dynamic websites, they do not require any Web programming or database design. A static site can be built by simply creating a few HTML pages and publishing them to a Web server.


### What Is Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)?
Amazon Simple Storage Service is storage for the Internet. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers.

Amazon S3 has a simple web services interface that you can use to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. It gives any developer access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast, inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of web sites. The service aims to maximize benefits of scale and to pass those benefits on to developers.
